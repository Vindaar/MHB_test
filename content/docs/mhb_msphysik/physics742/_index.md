**Contents of the Course**:
Almost hundred years ago, in 1924, A. Einstein and S.N. Bose predicted the existence of a new state of matter, the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate. It took 70 years to successfully realize this macroscopic quantum state in the lab using ultracold atomic gases (Nobel prize 2001). The main challenge was to achieve cooling to Nanokelvin temperatures, the coolest temperatures ever reached by mankind. Nowadays, ultracold gases are exciting systems to study a broad range of quantum phenomena. These phenomena range from the direct observation of quantum matter waves and superfluidity over the creation of artificial crystal structures as analogous to solids, to the realization of complex quantum phase transitions of interacting atoms, e.g. the formation of a bosonic Mott-insulator or the BCS superconducting state for Fermions. In this lecture we will discuss both the experimental and theoretical concepts of ultra-cold atomic gases.
