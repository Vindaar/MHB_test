**Requirements**:


**Preparation**:
Basic knowledge of programming and knowledge of simple C/C++ or Python constructs.

**Form of Testing and Examination**:
C/C++ part: Requirements for the examination (written or oral): successful work with the exercises.

Python part: Requirements for examination: successful implementation of the scientific projects in Python during the semester.

**Length of Course**:
1 semester

**Aims of the Course**:
C++ part: In-depth understanding of C++ and its applications in particle physics. Discussion of advanced features of C++ using examples from High Energy Physics. The course is intended for students with some background in C++ or for advanced students who wish to apply C++ in their graduate research.

Python part: Effective and flexible program solving with the easy-to-learn, high level programming language Python. The course addresses master and PhD students with prior Python-programming knowledge as taught in the bachelor course physics131.

**Contents of the Course**:
C++ part: - Basic ingredients of C++, - Object orientation: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, - How to solve physics problems with C++, - Standard Template Library, - C++ in data analysis, example: the ROOT library, - C++ and large scale calculations, - How to write and maintain complex programs, - Parallel computing and the Grid, - Debugging and profiling

Python part: - In-depth introduction to Python based on prior programming experience, - Introduction to numpy arrays (primary Python data structure for scientific computing), - Introduction to scientific-Python modules (scipy, astropy), - Interactive work / development with Python (ipython), - Web interaction with Python (jupyter notebooks, web and database queries), - Plotting with Python (the matplotlib module)
