1 semester

**Aims of the Course**:
Quantum field theory is one of the main tools of modern physics with many applications ranging from high-energy physics to solid state physics. A central topic of this course is the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and its relevance for phenomena like superconductivity, magnetism or mass generation in particle physics.

**Contents of the Course**:
Correlation functions: formalism, and their role as a bridge between theory and experiment

Renormalization

Topological concepts
