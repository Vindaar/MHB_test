**Length of Course**:
1 semester

**Aims of the Course**:
The goal of the course is to provide in-depth knowledge and to provide practical abilities in the field of holography as an actual topic of applied optics

**Contents of the Course**:
The course will cover the basic principle of holography, holographic recording materials, and applications of holography. In the first part the idea behind holography will be explained and different hologram types will be discussed (transmission and reflection holograms; thin and thick holograms; amplitude and phase holograms; white-light holograms; computer-generated holograms; printed holograms). A key issue is the holographic recording material, and several material classes will be introduced in the course (photographic emulsions; photochromic materials; photo-polymerization; photo-addressable polymers; photorefractive crystals; photosensitive inorganic glasses). In the third section several fascinating applications of holography will be discussed (art; security-features on credit cards, banknotes, and passports; laser technology; data storage; image processing; filters and switches for optical telecommunication networks; novelty filters; phase conjugation ["time machine"]; femtosecond holography; space-time conversion). Interested students can also participate in practical training. An experimental setup to fabricate own holograms is available
