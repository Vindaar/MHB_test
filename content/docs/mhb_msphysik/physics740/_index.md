**Requirements**:


**Preparation**:
Fundamentals of optics and quantum mechanics

**Form of Testing and Examination**:
Credit points can be obtained after successful carrying out the experiments and preparing a written report on selected experiments

**Length of Course**:
1 semester

**Aims of the Course**:
The students learn to handle optical setups and carry out optical experiments. This will prepare participants both for the successful completion of research projects in experimental quantum optics/photonics and tasks in the optics industry.

**Contents of the Course**:
Practical training in the field of optics, where the students start their experiment basically from scratch (i.e. an empty optical table). The training involves the following topics:

- diode lasers

- optical resonators

- acousto-optic modulators

- spectroscopy

- radiofrequency techniques

**Recommended Literature**:
Will be given by the supervisor
