**Aims of the Course**:
This course gives an introduction to various topological concepts and results that play an important role in modern theoretical physics.

**Contents of the Course**:
Elements of homotopy theory: homeomorphic spaces, homotopic maps, fundamental group, covering spaces, homotopy groups, long exact homotopy sequence of a fibration

Homology and cohomology: Poincare lemma, Mayer-Vietoris sequence, Cech-deRham complex, Hurewicz isomorphism theorem, spectral sequences

Vector bundles and characteristic classes: Euler form, Thom isomorphism, Chern classes

Applications: Berry phase; Dirac monopole problem; visualization of closed differential forms by Poincare duality; cohomology of electrical conductance; supersymmetry and Morse theory; index theorems; homotopy classification of topological insulators
