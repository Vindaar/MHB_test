**Requirements**:


**Preparation**:
Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics

**Form of Testing and Examination**:
Oral Examination

**Length of Course**:
1 semester

**Aims of the Course**:
Understanding the fundamental concepts of representation theory and its application to describe the symmetry of molecules

**Contents of the Course**:
The lecture introduces to group theory with special emphasis on representations and their use to describe the symmetry of molecules in high-resolution spectroscopy and in molecular physics generally. The theory is accompanied by a series of "prototypical" examples Topics covered are

- symmetry in general and symmetry of a molecule.

- groups and point groups.

- irreducible representations, characters.

- vanishing integral rule

- the Complete Nuclear Permutation-Inversion (CNPI) group.

- the Molecular Symmetry (MS) group).

- the molecular point group.

- classification of molecular states: electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin states

- nuclear spin statistical weights

- hyperfine structure

- non-rigid molecules (inversion, internal rotation)
