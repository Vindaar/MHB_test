cfContent = '''Based on the introductory course 'Astrophysics I' in the Bachelor program this course deepens the understanding in selected topical areas of relevance. These are:

Interstellar medium: molecular clouds, HII regions, photon dominated regions, shock waves, radiation processes, radiative transfer, astrochemistry

Star formation (low mass and high mass), planetary system formation

Galaxies: galactic structure, morphology, dynamics, chemical evolution, nuclei of active galaxies

Large scale structure of the universe: intergalactic distance ladder, galaxy clusters, dark matter, gravitational lenses, experimental cosmology
