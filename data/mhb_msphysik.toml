cfContent = '''Almost hundred years ago, in 1924, A. Einstein and S.N. Bose predicted the existence of a new state of matter, the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate. It took 70 years to successfully realize this macroscopic quantum state in the lab using ultracold atomic gases (Nobel prize 2001). The main challenge was to achieve cooling to Nanokelvin temperatures, the coolest temperatures ever reached by mankind. Nowadays, ultracold gases are exciting systems to study a broad range of quantum phenomena. These phenomena range from the direct observation of quantum matter waves and superfluidity over the creation of artificial crystal structures as analogous to solids, to the realization of complex quantum phase transitions of interacting atoms, e.g. the formation of a bosonic Mott-insulator or the BCS superconducting state for Fermions. In this lecture we will discuss both the experimental and theoretical concepts of ultra-cold atomic gases.



Outline: Introduction and revision of basic concepts, Fundamentals of atom-laser interaction

Laser cooling & trapping, Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic gases. Dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates

Optical lattices: strongly interacting atomic gases and quantum phase transitions

The crossover of Fermi-gases between a BCS superconducting state and a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules.

cfContent = '''Almost hundred years ago, in 1924, A. Einstein and S.N. Bose predicted the existence of a new state of matter, the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate. It took 70 years to successfully realize this macroscopic quantum state in the lab using ultracold atomic gases (Nobel prize 2001). The main challenge was to achieve cooling to Nanokelvin temperatures, the coolest temperatures ever reached by mankind. Nowadays, ultracold gases are exciting systems to study a broad range of quantum phenomena. These phenomena range from the direct observation of quantum matter waves and superfluidity over the creation of artificial crystal structures as analogous to solids, to the realization of complex quantum phase transitions of interacting atoms, e.g. the formation of a bosonic Mott-insulator or the BCS superconducting state for Fermions. In this lecture we will discuss both the experimental and theoretical concepts of ultra-cold atomic gases.

In the third section several fascinating applications of holography will be discussed (art; security-features on credit cards, banknotes, and passports; laser technology; data storage; image processing; filters and switches for optical telecommunication networks; novelty filters; phase conjugation [\"time machine\"]; femtosecond holography; space-time conversion).

- symmetry in general and symmetry of a molecule.

- groups and point groups.

- irreducible representations, characters.

- vanishing integral rule

- the Complete Nuclear Permutation-Inversion (CNPI) group.

- the Molecular Symmetry (MS) group).

- the molecular point group.

- classification of molecular states: electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin states

- nuclear spin statistical weights

- hyperfine structure

- non-rigid molecules (inversion, internal rotation)

cfContent = '''Almost hundred years ago, in 1924, A. Einstein and S.N. Bose predicted the existence of a new state of matter, the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate. It took 70 years to successfully realize this macroscopic quantum state in the lab using ultracold atomic gases (Nobel prize 2001). The main challenge was to achieve cooling to Nanokelvin temperatures, the coolest temperatures ever reached by mankind. Nowadays, ultracold gases are exciting systems to study a broad range of quantum phenomena. These phenomena range from the direct observation of quantum matter waves and superfluidity over the creation of artificial crystal structures as analogous to solids, to the realization of complex quantum phase transitions of interacting atoms, e.g. the formation of a bosonic Mott-insulator or the BCS superconducting state for Fermions. In this lecture we will discuss both the experimental and theoretical concepts of ultra-cold atomic gases.



Outline: Introduction and revision of basic concepts, Fundamentals of atom-laser interaction

Laser cooling & trapping, Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic gases. Dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates

Optical lattices: strongly interacting atomic gases and quantum phase transitions

The crossover of Fermi-gases between a BCS superconducting state and a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules.
