cfContent = '''The detection of the deflection of light in a gravitational field was not only one of the crucial tests of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, but has become in the past two decades a highly valuable tool for astronomers and cosmologists. It is ideally suited for studying the mass distribution of distant objects, search for compact objects as a potential constituent of the Galactic dark matter, provide powerful (and cheap) 'natural telescopes' to take a deeper look into the distant Universe, to measure the mass

distribution in clusters and on larger spatial scales, and to study the relation between luminous and dark matter in the Universe. Principles and methods are described in detail and the applications will be presented
